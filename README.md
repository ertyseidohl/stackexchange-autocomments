###[Q] More than one question asked
It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people answering your question and also others hunting for at least one of your questions. Thanks!

###[Q] Looking for a software recommendation
Unfortunately, questions asking for recommendations of books, tools, software libraries, tutorials or other off-site resources are off-topic here. However, you may find better luck at [Software Recommendations SE](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/).

###[Q] No MCVE
Please [edit] your question to include a [mcve]. Please read that link and make sure that the code you post in your question is minimal (only bare minimum of code necessary to reproduce), complete (all of the code necessary to reproduce) and verifiable (we can reproduce the issue using only the code in your question). JsFiddle links don't count as an MCVE. Without an MCVE in your question, this question is off-topic for $SITENAME$.

###[Q] Working code that needs a review
It seems that your code currently works, and you are looking to improve it. Generally these questions are too opinionated for this site, but you might find better luck at the [Code Review Stack Exchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/).

###[Q] Duplicate Closure

###[A] Nothing but a URL (and isn't spam)
A link to a solution is welcome, but please ensure your answer is useful without it: [add context around the link](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answers/8259#8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why itâ€™s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable. [Answers that are little more than a link may be deleted](https://stackoverflow.com/help/deleted-answers).

###[A] Answers without explanations
While this answer is probably correct and useful, it is preferred if you include some explanation along with it to explain how it helps to solve the problem. This becomes especially useful in the future, if there is a change (possibly unrelated) that causes it to stop working and users need to understand how it once worked.
